# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS MODEL

The execution of this project will follow the Agile Scrum methodology. Below are the key features of using Scrum in this project:

- **Short Iterations (Sprints):** The project will be divided into short cycles called sprints. Each sprint includes planning, development, review, and retrospective, allowing functional software increments to be delivered regularly.
- **Addition of New Modules:** At the end of each sprint, new modules or functionalities can be added to the system based on the user's priorities and needs, ensuring the software remains adaptable and continuously improvable.
- **Teamwork:** The software development and project management teams collaborate, assigning tasks equitably while leveraging the skills of each team member.
- **Review and Feedback:** At the end of each sprint, completed work is reviewed, and feedback is obtained from both the user and the team. This allows for continuous adjustments and improvements to the project.

## SCRUM TEAM

### Product Owner
The Product Owner represents the stakeholders, who are typically clients. To ensure that the Scrum Team always delivers value to the stakeholders and the business, the Product Owner defines product expectations, records product changes, and manages a Scrum backlog (a detailed and constantly updated task list for the Scrum project). They are also responsible for prioritizing the objectives of each sprint, ensuring that the most important features and deliverables are built during each iteration.

### Scrum Master
The Scrum Master leads the team to ensure they fully understand the Scrum methodology, adhere to its rules, and follow the processes effectively. They handle mentoring, coaching, training, facilitate meetings and events when necessary, and convey the overall project vision to the team. Additionally, they work alongside the Product Owner to maximize ROI.

The Scrum Master’s role can be summarized in two main tasks:
- **Managing the Scrum Process:** Responsible for ensuring the correct application of the methodology and facilitating the entire process. They ensure that Scrum generates value for the organization.
- **Removing Impediments:** The Scrum Master helps remove obstacles that may arise. They communicate the benefits of Scrum to the company, facilitating its implementation.

### Scrum Team
This is a self-organized group of 3 to 9 people with the commercial, design, analytical, and development skills to carry out the actual work, solve problems, and produce deliverable products. The Scrum Team members manage their tasks and are collectively responsible for meeting the goals of each sprint.

### Auxiliary Roles
Auxiliary roles include other stakeholders involved but not directly assigned to the Scrum project. These usually include clients, managers, and executive team members who consult, report progress, and gather feedback to work better and deliver maximum value.

### Stakeholders
Stakeholders are all individuals or organizations that have a direct or indirect relationship with the project and may be positively or negatively impacted at any time. They can be divided into two main groups:

- **Primary Stakeholders:** These have a direct relationship with the company and affect its processes. They may include customers, suppliers, shareholders, corporate partners, or employees.
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** These have an indirect connection with the company and do not affect its processes but can still be impacted by the company’s actions. This group includes media, competitors, governments, financial institutions, or the community.

## ROLE ASSIGNMENT
As defined in week 2, the human capital resource will assign the roles:

| Name                      | Role               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| CEO of the company          | Client             |
| Eng. Jessica Moreno         | Scrum Master       |
| Eng. Eleno Cruz             | Product Owner      |
| Stakeholders                |                    |

# Conclusions

Requirements analysis and system modeling using UML modeling allow you to structure an efficient solution that addresses Fyware's needs. The use of UML diagrams has been essential to model the proposed solution for Fyware. Each type of diagram is important in understanding, designing, and communicating the key elements of the system. This approach ensures that the proposed platform not only optimizes project management but also improves strategic alignment with business objectives, providing a customized solution for the VR software development sector.

The implementation of the Scrum methodology in Fyware turns out to be an effective solution to address the problem of Strategic Planning and Project Management in the field of software development. Scrum, as an agile methodology, allows the functional requirements of the system to be managed in an iterative and flexible way, ensuring that the final product is aligned with both the needs of the users and the strategic objectives of the company.

Functional requirements are obtained and refined through constant collaboration between the different actors involved in the project, such as product owners, scrum masters, and developers. In the context of Fyware, product owners represent managers and administrators, who have a clear vision and goals for the project planning and management platform.

- **Product Owner:** Represents Fyware's project and administration managers, in charge of defining requirements and prioritizing the backlog.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removing obstacles and making sure that the development team can work without interruptions.
- **Development Team:** Fyware's software developers, who work on the creation and implementation of the project planning and management platform.

Through the creation of the product backlog, key functionalities such as resource allocation, project progress visualization, and strategic process automation are prioritized. They provide Fyware with a solid framework to develop a strategic planning and project management platform tailored to its specific needs in the field of augmented and virtual reality software development.
